# UBTECH JIMU Bluetooth API (research draft)

> Note: UBTECH has not published an official public spec for JIMU BLE. The following is a working hypothesis to guide implementation and reverse-engineering. All packet formats and UUIDs must be verified against real hardware.
> inspiration: https://github.com/msantang78/node-jimu/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md

## Quick status (what's known vs missing)
- Framing/acks: `FB BF <len> ... checksum ED`, ack pattern `fb bf 06 <cmd> 00 <chk> ed`; error pattern `fb bf 06 <cmd> 01 <id> 01` with follow-up 0x05 error report.
- Working commands: init (0x36, 0x01, 0x08), enable (0x71), battery (0x27), ping (0x03), servo set/read (0x07/0x09/0x0B), motor (0x90 single/dual), sensor read (0x7E), ID changes (0x74/0x0C), eye LEDs (0x78/0x79), error query (0x05).
- Timing: reliable writes at ~25-50 ms spacing; 10 ms/5 ms produced drops. Notifications typically ~60 ms apart with jitter to ~1.3 s.
- **Critical constraint (no overlap):** only one command may be in flight at a time. After sending a command that expects a response (e.g. `0x08`, `0x27`, `0x0B`, `0x7E`), do not send any other command until the corresponding response arrives (or a timeout is hit). Overlapping commands can cause missing responses and repeated timeouts.
- BLE layout: custom service starting with `49535343`; characteristic order not locked (notify/write selection heuristics in code). Needs on-device UUID confirmation.
- Missing/needs check: service/characteristic UUIDs and order; meaning of 0x72, 0x2b, 0x2c, 0x3b, 0x91, 0x92; speaker control path; sensor value scales/units; eye segment masks; MTU limits; multi-frame notification splitting rules.
- Redundant/raw sections below are kept for now-tagged "(review/remove?)" where they look like unprocessed captures or duplicated notes.

## Plan to confirm protocol
- Use a BLE sniffer (nRF Sniffer or similar) or the nRF Connect app to inspect services/characteristics after pairing with the official JIMU app. => not working, and can't work. BT transmision is ENCRYPTED!
- Log traffic when orginal app is connecting and preparing JIMU brick, make every posible action in device to generate most commands to detect them all. 
- Generate abobe command from software to check what is happening. (Will sniff serial bus)
- Validate MTU, write-without-response vs write-with-response, and notification characteristics.
- OLD android device needed! galaxy S4, Android 5 - works, newer - not! (HCI log not generated). 
  - Enable programer mode
  - enable bluetooth HCI log
  - unpair bluetooth
  - reboot phone!
  - generate bluetooth trafic
  - using `adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/btsnoop_hci.log .` , get log
  - open log with Wireshark (field btspp.data - contains our protocol)
  - create disected for this data (to analise)
- create serial sniffer to check what is sending to devices by central unit with simulated BT commands.

## Findings from `msantang78/node-jimu` and real sniffing (raw notes; needs cleanup/verification)
- Packet framing:
  - Header bytes: `0xFB, 0xBF`.
  - Length byte: `payload.length + 4` (length + payload + checksum in builder logic).
  - Payload data: `[command, ...params]`.
  - Checksum byte: sum of bytes starting at the length byte (length + payload).
  - Terminator: `0xED`.
  - Example full packet (read servo position): `[0xFB, 0xBF, 0x07, 0x0B, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0B, 0xED]`.
  - Generic ack pattern observed during scans: `fb bf 06 <cmd> 00 <checksum> ed` (echoes the command byte with a zero status and checksum). - means OK.
  - If expected response should be `[<cmd> 00]`, but returs `[<cmd>, 0x01, <id>, 0x01]` -> means ERROR on device `<id>`.
    This response if for motor or servo actions.
    There should be cmd=`0x05` extra response emited with error details.
  - Sometimes single Notification can send multipre responses gulued together like: <fb bf 06 08 ee fc ed fb bf 06 08 ee fc ed>, this should be split to multiple responses, <fb ... ed> , <fb ... ed>
- BLE layout (implicit):
  - Device discovered by advertised local name match.
  - After `discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics`, writes go to `characteristics[0]`, notifications read from `characteristics[1]` (UUIDs not specified).
  - Observed: the device emits short ack/position notifications for servo commands (`0x09`/`0x0B`). If notify characteristics are not subscribed and drained, subsequent writes may be processed only once (ATT queue stalls). Subscribing and parsing notifications restores repeated set-position writes.
- Implemented commands (to validate):

Boot sequence (done by original app):
- Brick info (`0x36`):
    - `[0x36, 0x00]` querybrick info
    - response hex (Jimu2): `[36 4a 69 6d 75 32]`    (Jimu2)
    - response hex (Jimu1): `[0x36 0x00 0x53 0x31 0x4a 0x49 0x4d 0x55]` // old brick

- Probe brick devices (`0x01`):
    - `[0x01, 0x00]` query brick info, brick start probing all devices
    - response hex:   `[01 00 4a 49 4d 55 32 50]`   (\00JIMU2 P)
    - what brick probes - scan on serial interface: (new brick JIMU2)

    - `[0x05, 0x00]` query returns `[05 00]` when no faults. 
    - `[0x05, 0x01]` meaning unknown.
    - Error responses (e.g., motor error) appear as `[0x05, 0x0400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000]` with bitmasks; need mapping for error types/bits. This example means motor ID1 error.

          response   `[0x71, 0x08, 0x01, 0x00]`


-  BATTERY (`0x27`) query for charging and voltage, don know how to calculate voltage / level -
    - `[0x27, 0x00]` query, can be voltage?
    - response hex: `[27 <charging 0|1> 00 volt_high volt_low]`
      * response is emited after connecting/disconnecting from chargoing too (without request!)
      * voltage = (volt_high * 256 + volt_low) / 2500   (need to be calibrated)

    - samples    hex: `[27 00 00 50 4c]` <- difrent aswers from dif brick/config?
                    `[27 00 00 50 4b]`

-  query??? (`0x2c`) - during init: brick?
    - `[0x2c, 0x00]` query / set ??
    - response hex: `[2c 00 33 31 31 20 05 51 4d 57 3f 00 2d 00]`  
                    `[2c 00 36 33 37 20 13 51 4d 59 18 00 28 00]` <= difrent aswers from dif brick/config?

    - no serial data. when response short `[2b 02]`
    - no idea what it is doing
    - need to investigate

COMMANDS:
------
-  PING (`0x03`) - every few second, looks like ping.:
    - `[0x03, 0x00]` ping?
    - response hex: `[09 00]`  
    - to make sure that brick/brick still connected.
    - orginal app emit this every few seconds
    - no serial data.

-  CLEAR_ERROR (`0x3c`) - not sure if correct
    - send: `[0x03, 0x00]` 
    - was send after error twice,
    - no replay

- Servo continous rotation (`0x07`):
    - Single servo: `[0x07, 0x01, servoId, direction(1|2), velocity_hi, velocity_lo]` (velocity is 16-bit; effective range observed up to ~1000).
    - Dual/axle (observed): 
          `[0x07, 0x02, servoId1, servoId2, direction((0?)|1|2), velocity_hi, velocity_lo]`.
          0x07, 02 01 02 00 00 00  <- stop?
          0x07, 02 01 02 02 01 07
          0x07, 02 01 02 01 01 cc
      - to drive two servos together - that same direction and speed. 
      - can be usefull for 4 whell (pairs run that same)
    - Quad/pairs (observed): 
        `[0x07, 0x04, servoId1, servoId2, servoId3, servoId4, direction(0?|1|2), velocity_hi, velocity_lo]`
         0x07, 04 01 02 03 04 - 01 01 cc
         0x07, 04 01 02 03 04 - 02 01 cc
         0x07, 04 01 02 03 04 - 00 00 00	// ? stop
      - Drives four servos at once  - that same direction and speed

    - other strange: ? 3 wheels - to check
        `[0x07, 0x03, servoId1, servoId2, servoId3, direction(0?|1|2), velocity_hi, velocity_lo]`
        sniffed:
         `[0x07, 0x03, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0x54]`
    - Six (3 pairs) - to be tested
        `[0x07, 0x06, servoId1, servoId2, servoId3, servoId4, servoId5, servoId6, direction(0?|1|2), velocity_hi, velocity_lo]`

    - Rotation timeout: any rotation command expires after ~6 seconds unless refreshed; resend to keep spinning.
    - ACK/notify example after rotation: `fb bf 06 07 00 0d ed`. (cmd: 07 00)
    - Blocking servo ID1 during continuous rotation did **not** produce a 0x05 error report; observed responses included short acks (`0700`). Unplugging the servo produced a longer frame `07 01 00 00 00 01` (meaning unknown, likely “servo missing”).

- Servo positions (`0x09`): selector + can move multiple servos at once.
  - Payload (tested): `[0x09, sel32_25, sel24_17, sel16_9, sel8_1, s1, s2, s3, s..., speed, 0, 0]`.
  - `sel*` form a bitmask of target servos; `sel8_1` lowest byte selects IDs 1-8 (e.g., `0x07` selects 1,2,3). If no servo is selected the command is ignored. 
  - number of `s*` depend number of selectecd servos. If 1 selected - s1, if 3 s1,s2,s3 ect. Data is featched from lowes ID servo to bigest.
  - Positions: 0-252, with ~120 as center. After the command, selected servos hold position.
  - `speed` is a single byte; speed/20 = second for movments, from current to desired position
  - last two bytes remain unknown; `[0x01,0x90]` seen in sniffing, `[0x00,0x00]` also works, no visible impact in current tests
  - Observed notification/response after `0x09` write: `cmd=0x09`, params `0x00` (len=1) appears to be an OK/ack for the command.

  - sniffed example :
      `[0x09, 00 00 00 0f 20 78 78 78 14 01 90]`
      `[0x09, 00 00 00 01 11 05 00 64]`
  - Error/absent servo: unplugging servo ID1 produced `09 01 00 00 00 01` (len=6) when commanding position; normal acks were `09 00`.

- Read servo position (`0x0B`):
  - Single read: `[0x0B, servoId, 00]` returns frame: 01 aa 00 00 00 <angle>
  - All read: `[0x0B, 00, 00]` returns frames for every connected servo
  - Counterclockwise rotation decreases the reported value; values below ~120 indicate CCW rotation relative to center.
  - Reading a servo position releases its hold (a held servo after a set-position will unlock when read).
  - read all - best method to STOP all movment!

- Sensors read: (`0x7E`) 
  to work sensor need to be ENBALED, by "ENABLE" cmd, once per connection during boot sequence.
  - query single sensor (`0x7E, 0x01, type, ID`): 
     type = 0x01 - IR,
            0x06 - Ultrasonic
      ID - id of selected sensor
    - response: `[0x7E 010101 06 000105c7]`
        0x7E - response for cmd 0x7e
        0x01 0x01 0x01- single read ??
        0x06 - type of read: ultrasonic
        0x00 - ignore
        0x01 - ID of sensor
        last 2 bytes = result for ultrasonic. (16-bit int) => value /10 = range in cm. if =0 then out of range.
  - query 2 sensors: (`0x7E, 0x02, type1, ID1 , type2, ID2`)
      query 2 sensors at time, 
        type1, ID1 - first sensor (type1 as type descriped above)
        type2, ID2 - second sensor 
      WARNING, simulationus reading of 2 sensors of that same type not posible!,
          only last sensor of that type returned, package shorter that because missing data
    response:

        0x7E - response for cmd 0x7e
        010102 - dual read?

          06
          0x00 - ignore
          0x01 - ID of sensor
          00aa - value of Ultrasonic

  - query multiple sensors (to check) (`0x7E, number of sensors , (type, ID) ,  ...`)
       part (type, ID) should repeat x number of sensors

  - Eye animation (`0x78`): `[0x78, 0x04, eyesMask, animationId, 0x00, repetitions, R, G, B]`.
      - eyeMask: bitmask of eye IDs (0x01 = ID1, 0x02 = ID2, 0x03 = both, etc.).
      - animationId:
         * 0 - white blink full
         * 1 - white line blink
         * 2 - white up to half blink
         * 3 - white up shake
         * 4 - white midle to up move

      - Color bytes matter: R/G/B change the visible color for these animations (tested with eye ID1). `0,0,0` renders as the same white baseline as `255,255,255`; non-zero single channels do change hue (e.g., `255,0,0` = red).
      - Error acks: when the eye is connected, responses to 0x78 are short acks `78 04 01 00`; when the eye is unplugged, they return `78 04 01 01` (status=0x04, deviceId=1, detail=1). A 0x71 enable on the eye also yields `71 04 01 00` when present.

- Gaps/risks:
  - UUIDs, MTU, and characteristic order are not fixed in the repo.
  - Touch/color/other sensors are untested (we only have servos, motors, IR, ultrasonic, speakers, segment eyes).
  - Speaker is a standard Bluetooth audio device; not controlled via these commands (only detected in 0x08/0x71 mask).
  - Module addressing:
    - Modules have per-type IDs starting at 1 (servo 1, motor 1, eye 1, IR 1, ultrasonic 1, etc.). IDs are unique within a type; type + ID is the unique address. This matches the official wired Arduino library and is likely true over BLE; ensure BLE payloads carry the target module id.


## Expected device layout (to verify/expand)
- Likely a single primary service with vendor-specific UUID (commonly 0xFFE0/0xFFE1 style or 128-bit custom); verify with nRF Connect.
- One write characteristic for commands; one notify characteristic for responses/events (in the repo they are characteristics[0] write, [1] notify).
- Device advertises a name containing `JIMU` and may expose hardware/firmware/version characteristics (not documented in repo).

## Working command model (proposed)
- Session setup:
  - Connect, set MTU if supported (try 247), subscribe to notifications.
  - Send a handshake/ping to confirm link.
- Boot sequence:
  - cmd 0x36 -> board INFO
  - cmd 0x01 -> start scan
  - cmd 0x08 -> detect / list all detected modules (remember all detected modules)
  - cmd 0x05 -> check for errors
  - cmd 0x71 -> enable all detected modules (that need enable)
  - cmd 0x27 -> check battery voltage and charging status
  - Cache module map for block toolboxes and validation.
- servo angleDeg representation
  - on-wire raw range is typically 0..240; the app/SDK uses degrees in -120..120, with 0 as neutral (center)
  - conversion: `deg = raw - 120`, `raw = deg + 120` (clamp to bounds)
- Actuation (examples to design/verify):
  - `setServoPosition(id, angleDeg, durationMs)`.
  - `rotateServo(id, direction, speedPct)` and `powerDownServo(id)`.
  - `rotateMotor(id, direction, speedPct)` and `powerDownMotor(id)`.
  - `eyeColor(id,R,G,B,duration)`
  - `eyeColorSegment(id,[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],duration)`
  - `ultrasonicColor(id,R,G,B,duration)`
  - Control panel outputs: `setLed(id, color)` or `setIndicator(id, value)` if supported.
- Sensors (examples):
  - `readUltrasonic(id) -> distance`.
  - `readIR(id) -> proximity/white level`.
  - `readTouch(id) -> pressed, double pressed, long pressed`.
  - `readServoPosition(id) -> { id, raw, deg }` (and the SDK emits `servoPosition` events in the same units).
  - `readBattery() -> voltage`.
  - `readBatteryCharge() -> bool`.
  - Control panel inputs: 
     - button - start code block
     - switch - on/off - `readSwitch(id) -> bool`
     - slider - readSlider(id) -> value, 
     - joystick (2-way) `readJoystickX(id)` `readJoystickX(id)`, + code executed when changed
     - timmer - start code block every X seconds.
     - run - code block executed when model is started.
  - Control panel hardware inputs:
    - events: key pressed
    - joystick data, sticks position and button pressed
- Events:
  - Notifications for module changes, low battery, and possibly control panel widget changes.


## Cross-reference: official wired uKitExplore library (direct bus)
- Uses the same start/end sentinels `0xFB ... 0xED` but different framing:
  - Second byte is a module-class “head” (e.g., `0xFA` for servos; `0x10/0x06/0x05/0x03` for other devices) with a bit-swapped copy; payload includes module ID (per type, starting at 1).
  - Length and checksum differ: many helpers use CRC8-ITU over `[head..payload]`, some use a simple sum; `0xED` terminates.
  - Commands are per module type (servo read/write, ultrasonic/IR/color/button/eye light). Servo get-position responses map roughly to -120..+120 range.
- Implication for BLE:
  - BLE packets in node-jimu do not expose the module “head” byte, but likely still include a module ID in the params (e.g., `motorId` in `0x07`, servo id(s) in `0x09/0x0B`).
  - Unknown tail fields in BLE payloads (e.g., last two bytes of `0x09`) may correspond to control bytes/checksums seen in wired frames; verify with captures.
  - When gaps exist in node-jimu docs, prefer the wired patterns for ID usage and sentinel/checksum expectations, but confirm against BLE traffic.

## Security/permissions
- Pairing is usually Just Works. Ensure bonding is optional and handle rejected write permissions gracefully.
- Provide a reconnect loop with exponential backoff and UI status.

## TODO after sniffing
- Lock down service/characteristic UUIDs and confirm characteristic order.
- Measure timing limits (min command spacing, notification rate) and update runtime throttling/backoff.
- Define sensor response parsing (offsets, units) and eye/light masks.

## BLE timing observations (Dec 2025)
- Testing battery queries (0x27) in bursts of 30 frames: 25–50 ms gaps delivered 0 drops; 10 ms caused 10/30 missing responses; 5 ms caused 8/30 missing responses. Runtime writes should clamp to ~25 ms minimum for reliability; faster rates need retries/backoff.
- Observed notification cadence over the sweep: p50 ≈ 60 ms, p95 ≈ 240 ms, max ≈ 1.38 s with occasional back-to-back frames (min 0). Plan for jitter and buffer draining rather than strict periodicity.
- Error query (0x05, 0x00) returns `[05 00]` when no faults are present; not a fault condition.
- Sensor read timing (IR/US/servo position ID1; bursts of 30 per gap):
  - Stable at 50–200 ms gaps (0 drops). At 25 ms gaps: IR dropped 4/30, US dropped 3/30, servo dropped 1/30. At 10 ms gaps: IR dropped 12/30, US dropped 13/30, servo dropped 10/30.
  - Latency: for 50–100 ms gaps p50 ~70–90 ms; at 25 ms gaps p50 ~270–320 ms (p95 ~440–500 ms); at 10 ms gaps p50 ~300–330 ms (p95 ~575–603 ms).
  - Ultrasonic sometimes emitted extra notifications (e.g., 46/30 at 200 ms gap), so correlate by command byte, not just counts.
